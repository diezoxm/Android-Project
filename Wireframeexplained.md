Hand-drawn wireframe for ClockRise
Considering the features of ClockRise, I suggest starting with a hand-drawn wireframe focusing on simplicity and ease of use. The initial setup screen would have minimal input fields for travel details, aiming to reduce the user's effort. The main interface would prioritize displaying the recommended departure time, with an option to expand details on traffic and public transport schedules as a secondary. The settings page would be straightforward, offering customization options for notifications and travel preferences.

Alternative Wireframe Suggestion
For an alternative wireframe, I envision a dashboard approach for the main interface, where the recommended departure time is prominently displayed at the top. Below this, smaller widgets or cards could provide quick glimpses into traffic updates, public transport schedules, and even weather conditions, offering a comprehensive pre-travel snapshot. This dashboard approach ensures that users have all pertinent information at a glance, enhancing decision-making and confidence in the provided departure time.

Why This Wireframe Might Be a Better Solution
Comprehensive Overview: The dashboard layout gives users immediate access to all critical information, not just the departure time. This holistic approach can increase user satisfaction by providing valuable context for the departure recommendation.
Enhanced User Engagement: Interactive elements, like expandable cards for traffic and weather details, can make the app more engaging and informative, encouraging users to rely on it for all their pre-travel needs.
Adaptability: This design easily accommodates additional features in the future, such as integration with calendar apps or live updates from airports and train stations, without cluttering the interface.
